# Error Handling

In Solidity, error handling is crucial for controlling contract execution and managing state under failure conditions. Effective error handling prevents contracts from executing unintended actions and ensures that users receive meaningful feedback when operations fail.

### Introduction to Error Handling

Error handling in Solidity involves several key mechanisms:

1. **Revert**: Reverts the transaction and undoes all changes made to the state, while providing an error message.
2. **Require**: A shorthand for reverting the transaction if a condition is not met.
3. **Assert**: Used to test for internal errors and invariants; reverts the transaction if a condition evaluates to false.
4. **Try/Catch**: Handles exceptions in external function calls and contract creations.

### Revert

The `revert` statement stops execution and reverts any changes made to the state during the transaction. It also allows you to provide an error message.

#### Example of Revert

```solidity
function buyItem(uint itemId) public payable {
    if (msg.value < items[itemId].price) {
        revert("Payment is not enough.");
    }
    // Continue with purchase logic
}
```

### Require

`Require` is used to assert conditions before executing an operation. If the condition is false, the operation is reverted and a specified error message is returned. It is most commonly used to validate inputs and conditions.

#### Example of Require

```solidity
function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance.");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

### Assert

`Assert` is used for checking invariants and internal conditions that should never fail if the contract functions correctly. It consumes all gas when an assertion fails, signaling a critical error.

#### Example of Assert

```solidity
function divide(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
    assert(b != 0);  // Prevent division by zero
    return a / b;
}
```

### Try/Catch

Introduced in Solidity 0.6, `try/catch` blocks allow handling exceptions from external contract calls or contract creations using `new`.

#### Example of Try/Catch

```solidity
interface IExternalContract {
    function someFunction(uint x) external returns (bool);
}

contract Caller {
    IExternalContract externalContract;

    constructor(address _contractAddress) {
        externalContract = IExternalContract(_contractAddress);
    }

    function callExternalFunction(uint x) public returns (bool) {
        try externalContract.someFunction(x) {
            return true;
        } catch {
            // Handle the case where the call fails
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

Do not worry if you have not understood the `interface`. You will see interface in the next lesson.

### Best Practices in Error Handling

- Use `require` for input validation or conditions that must be met for the function to proceed.
- Use `assert` to check for conditions that indicate a bug in the contract code.
- Handle potential failures in external calls using `try/catch`.
- Provide clear and informative error messages to help with debugging and user interaction.

### Conclusion

Effective error handling is crucial for developing robust and secure smart contracts. It ensures that contracts only perform intended actions and provide useful feedback, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of your applications.
