# A Mini Solidity Tutorial

Welcome to this Solidity tutorial. This tutorial is for the ones, who have experience with a programming language and want to learn Solidity.

## Who is This Tutorial For?

This tutorial is not designed to be a stand alone tutorial for learning Solidity. However, a lot of important concepts has been explained so that this tutorial can be used to be a general reference while learning Solidity.

## What Can Be Done With Solidity?

Solidity is designed as a programming language for smart contract development on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. This tutorial specifically designed keeping considering, you are learning about Scroll blockchain, a layer 2 solution for Ethereum blockchain but again Solidity and this tutorial can be used for any EVM based blockchains.

## How to Use This Tutorial?

This tutorial can be used in any why that you like. On the other hand, my personal recommendation is to try to practice what has been taught in each section on [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) after completing. You can try to create a contract for specifically the topic of each section.
