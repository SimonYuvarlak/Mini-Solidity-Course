# Functions and Modifiers

## Events in Solidity

Events in Solidity provide a way for smart contracts to log activities and changes in state that can be tracked by external consumers, like frontend applications or server-side monitoring tools. They are especially useful for signaling that something important has occurred within the contract, without changing any state.

### Purpose of Events

Events are primarily used to inform external listeners about transactions and significant state changes or actions within a smart contract. They can be thought of as logging tools which are cheaper than storing information directly in the contract's storage.

### Syntax of Events

Events are declared using the `event` keyword followed by a list of parameters that will be indexed and logged by the event. Here’s how to declare an event:

```solidity
event EventName(type indexed parameter1, type parameter2);
```

Indexed parameters help to filter events when searching the log history. You can index up to three parameters per event.

#### Example of Declaring and Emitting an Event

Here's an example of a smart contract that uses an event to log account activities:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AccountManager {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Declare an event
    event BalanceUpdated(address indexed account, uint256 newBalance);

    // Function to deposit funds
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit BalanceUpdated(msg.sender, balances[msg.sender]);
    }

    // Function to withdraw funds
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        emit BalanceUpdated(msg.sender, balances[msg.sender]);
    }
}
```

- **BalanceUpdated**: This event is emitted every time a user’s balance is updated, either through depositing or withdrawing funds.
- **Emitting an Event**: The `emit` keyword is used to trigger the event, logging the address of the user and their new balance.

### Characteristics of Events

- **Storage and Gas Efficiency**: Events consume less gas than storing data directly as they don't alter the blockchain's state but only add to its logs.
- **External Monitoring**: Events can be monitored and acted upon by external systems or interfaces, enabling reactive functionalities based on contract activities.
- **Traceability and Debugging**: They provide a traceable history of significant operations and changes, aiding in debugging and verifying contract behavior.

### Practical Use Cases

- **User Notifications**: Alerting users when important changes or actions occur, such as transaction confirmations or status updates.
- **Data Feed for UI**: Providing a live feed of contract activity to user interfaces without incurring the cost of state reads.
- **Audit and Security**: Events provide an audit trail that can be monitored and analyzed for security purposes.

Now, you have all the necessary information to work with functions on Solidity. Even though your knowledge is enough to create smart contracts, let's take a look for more advanced usages and tips that you may find it useful on the next part.
