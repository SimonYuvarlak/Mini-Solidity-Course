# Functions and Modifiers

Welcome to this lesson where you are going to learn about functions and modifiers.
In Solidity, we communicate with Smart Contracts using functions. There are two different type of functions, `execute` and `query` functions.

## Execute Functions

In blockchain, data is hosted and compute power is provided for you. In return, you need to pay gas fees for operations that require data alteration on the blockchain. These type of functions are called `Execute Functions`.

## Query Functions

In public blockchains, data is available to all. That is one of the selling points for public blockchains. For that reason, it is free to read data from public blockchains. To read data from blockchain, you will use `Query Functions`.

- Now, before moving onto learning about functions, let's quickly review the three primary types of data storage in Solidity. It is essential to know these types to use it in the functions.

## Storage, Memory, and Calldata in Solidity

In Solidity, when you're working with functions, understanding where and how data is stored can significantly impact the performance and cost of your smart contracts. There are three primary types of data storage in Solidity: **storage**, **memory**, and **calldata**. Let's explore each of these to see how they affect your contracts.

### Storage

**Storage** is where all the contract state variables reside. It's permanent storage that persists across function calls and transactions. Think of it like a computer's hard drive, where your files remain unless you decide to delete them. Accessing and modifying storage is costly in terms of gas, so it's best used for data that you need to retrieve or modify throughout the life of the contract.

### Memory

**Memory** is a temporary space that is erased between external function calls. It's like the RAM in your computer, which gets cleared when you turn off the machine. Memory is cheaper to use than storage and is ideal for temporary variables created during function execution.

### Calldata

**Calldata** is a special data location that contains function arguments, only available to `external` functions. Like memory, it is temporary and cannot be modified, but it's even cheaper to use. This makes it perfect for read-only or pass-through data.

These definitions can seems a little vague for now but do not worry, it will make more sense once you have seem them in use.

## General Function Syntax in Solidity

In Solidity, functions are the primary means through which you interact with a contract. Each function in Solidity can read and modify the contract's state or perform a computation. Understanding the basic syntax of how to define functions is essential before diving into more complex aspects like visibility, mutability, and custom modifiers.

### Defining a Function

A function in Solidity is defined using the keyword `function`, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (if any), the visibility specifier, and other optional modifiers such as `returns` which specify the return type of the function.

```solidity
function functionName(parameterType1 parameterName1, parameterType2 parameterName2, ...)
    visibilityModifier
    otherModifiers
    returns (returnType)
{
    // Function body
}
```

### Components of a Function:

- **Function Name**: The identifier used to call the function.
- **Parameters**: A comma-separated list specifying the input variables along with their types. Parameters are enclosed in parentheses.
- **Visibility Modifier**: This defines the accessibility of the function with respect to other contracts and accounts. Common visibility specifiers are `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`.
- **Other Modifiers**: Include keywords like `pure`, `view`, `payable`, etc., which describe certain conditions or behaviors regarding the function.
- **Return Types**: Specified after the `returns` keyword, it indicates the type of data the function will return.

- Here's a simple example of a Solidity function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleContract {
    uint private count = 0;

    // A public function that increments the count by a given value
    function increment(uint value) public {
        count += value;
    }

    // A function to retrieve the current count
    function getCount() public view returns (uint) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

- `increment`: This function takes one parameter, `value`, and adds it to the `count` state variable. It is accessible to anyone who interacts with the contract because it is marked as `public`.
- `getCount`: This function returns the current value of `count`. It does not modify the state (as indicated by the `view` modifier), and it also returns a `uint` type.

Now that you have the basic introduction for the function in Solidity, you are ready to learn about `Function Visibility and Return Values`.
