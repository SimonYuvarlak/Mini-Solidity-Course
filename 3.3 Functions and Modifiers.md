# Functions and Modifiers

Before starting to talk about modifiers, there is a very important concept that is used in modifiers, `require`statement. Let's take a look what is does and why we have it, then it is time for modifiers.

## Require Statement in Solidity

The `require` statement in Solidity is a control structure used to validate inputs and conditions before executing further code within a function. It's pivotal for error handling and ensuring that functions only proceed under specific circumstances.

### Usage of Require

The `require` function is used to check for certain conditions; if the condition is not met, the operation is reverted, and the gas used up to that point is consumed. However, any remaining gas is refunded. This is particularly useful for validating function arguments, maintaining invariants, and managing user permissions.

#### Syntax and Example

Here's the basic syntax of the `require` statement:

```solidity
require(condition, "Error message if condition fails");
```

#### Practical Example

Consider a simple contract that manages user balances and requires a minimum deposit amount:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeDeposit {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    uint public constant MIN_DEPOSIT = 1 ether;
    // constant means that the value of the variable cannot be changed after it's set initially.
    // In Solidity, ether is a built-in unit of value. This line says the minimum deposit is equal to 1 ether.

    // Function to deposit Ether into the contract
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= MIN_DEPOSIT, "Deposit must be at least 1 Ether");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Function to withdraw all balances
    function withdraw() public {
        uint balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");

        // The following line will be retrieve token for the msg.sender
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

- **deposit**: This function uses `require` to ensure that the Ether sent to the function meets a minimum required amount (`MIN_DEPOSIT`). If the condition fails, the transaction reverts, and the provided error message is returned.
- **withdraw**: Another use of `require` checks if the user has a balance to withdraw. It also ensures the transfer of Ether succeeds, reverting the transaction if it does not.

### Implications of Using Require

1. **Reverting Changes**: If a `require` statement fails, all changes to the state made by the function are reverted, making it a safe way to handle errors or invalid states.
2. **Gas Efficiency**: While `require` does consume gas until the point of failure, it prevents further execution, saving potentially wasted gas from executing doomed operations.
3. **Error Messaging**: The ability to include error messages in `require` statements provides clarity to transactions, helping users understand why transactions may have failed.

Now, as promised, it is time to check the modifiers!
