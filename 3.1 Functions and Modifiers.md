# Function and Modifiers

## Function Visibility and Returning Values in Solidity

In Solidity, function visibility specifies who can access the function and how it can be accessed within and outside of the contract. Additionally, functions can return values using the `returns` keyword, a critical feature for interacting with and managing contract data.

### Function Visibility

Solidity provides several types of visibility for functions:

- **Public**: Functions declared as `public` can be called from anywhere, both inside and outside the contract. This includes other contracts and transactions. Public functions are part of the contract interface.

- **Private**: `Private` functions are only visible to the contract they are defined in and cannot be accessed from derived contracts or from the external world. Use private functions when you want to restrict access to contract functionality strictly within the contract.

- **Internal**: Similar to `private`, `internal` functions can only be accessed from within the contract they are defined in and from other contracts that inherit from it. They are not accessible from outside contracts directly.

- **External**: `External` functions are meant to be called from other contracts and transactions, similar to public functions. However, they cannot be called internally, except using `this.functionName()`. Typically, external functions are more efficient when they receive large arrays of data.

### Returning Values from Functions

Functions in Solidity can return values back to the caller. The return type must be specified in the function declaration, and the `return` statement is used to specify the output value.

#### Syntax

```solidity
function functionName(parameters) visibilityModifier returns (returnType) {
    // Function logic
    return returnValue;
}
```

### Example

Consider a contract that manages users in a system:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UserManager {
    struct User {
        uint id;
        string name;
    }

    User[] private users;

    // Add a new user and return the user's ID
    function addUser(string memory name) public returns (uint) {
        users.push(User(users.length, name));
        return users.length - 1;
    }

    // Retrieve a user by ID
    function getUser(uint id) external view returns (uint, string memory) {
        require(id < users.length, "User does not exist.");
        User memory user = users[id];
        return (user.id, user.name);
    }

    // Internal function to update a user's name
    function updateUserName(uint id, string memory newName) internal {
        require(id < users.length, "User does not exist.");
        users[id].name = newName;
    }

    // Private function that checks if a user exists
    function userExists(uint id) private view returns (bool) {
        return id < users.length;
    }
}
```

- **addUser**: This public function adds a new user to the `users` array and returns the user's ID. It is a function can returns a value.

- **getUser**: Marked as `external`, this function allows other contracts to retrieve user information by ID but can't be called internally (except through `this.getUser(id)`).

- **updateUserName**: An `internal` function, it's accessible within this contract and any derived contracts, showing how to restrict function accessibility to within the contract family.

- **userExists**: A `private` function that checks if a user exists based on the ID. It is only callable within this contract.

## View and Pure Functions in Solidity

In Solidity, functions can be declared as `view` or `pure` to promise not to modify the state. Understanding these function types is crucial for optimizing gas usage and ensuring predictable behavior in your smart contracts.

### View Functions

`View` functions are those that promise not to modify the state of the contract. They can read data from the blockchain but cannot alter it. These functions do not consume gas when called by an external caller (outside of a transaction that modifies state).

#### When to Use View Functions

Use `view` functions when you need to access or return data from the blockchain without making any modifications to the state. Common examples include retrieving balances, computing values based on state variables, or checking conditions.

#### Syntax and Example

```solidity
function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
    return address(this).balance;
}
```

This function `getBalance` returns the contract's balance and does not modify the state, making it a `view` function.

### Pure Functions

`Pure` functions promise not to read from or modify the state of the contract. They can only use their function arguments and any hard-coded values to compute and return data.

#### When to Use Pure Functions

Use `pure` functions for calculations or logic that depend solely on the input parameters and not on any contract state. They are ideal for utility functions within your contract, such as computing hash values, validating data, or performing arithmetic operations.

#### Syntax and Example

```solidity
function add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This function `add` takes two uint values and returns their sum. Since it does not interact with any state variables nor reads from the blockchain, it is marked as `pure`.

### Practical Considerations

- **Gas Efficiency**: Both `view` and `pure` functions can be used to save gas when they are called externally. Internally, they behave like regular functions.
- **Modifiers**: These functions can also use other modifiers, such as `public`, `private`, etc., to further define their visibility and access.
- **Error Handling**: Even though they don't modify state, these functions can still use conditions and revert transactions if called within a state-changing transaction when certain conditions are not met.

Congrulations making this far! Since Solidity is specifically designed for smart contract development, it may have some functionalities that you are now very familiar of like the function visibility. Do not worry tho, practice makes everything perfect and once you start using these features, they will feel much better, I promise :)
